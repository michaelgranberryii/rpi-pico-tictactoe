# Project Title

Raspberry Pi Pico - TicTacToe

## Description

This project uses a Raspberry Pi Pico to implement a Tic-Tac-Toe game, where the players interact with a Tic-Tac-Toe board that is printed to a serial terminal via USB connection. Each player's turn is visually represented by an illuminated green LED (for X) and a red LED (for O). When a player wins, their LED flashes at 1Hz. Similarly, when there is a tie, both LEDs will flash. Three buttons are used to interact with the game. Button 1 is used to traverse the board, button 2 is used to enter your letter in the selected spot, and button 3 is used to reset the game once a win or tie occurs.
